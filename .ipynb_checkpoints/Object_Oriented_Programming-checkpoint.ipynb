    "**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects — reusable, self-contained units that combine data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into a single structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of just writing a sequence of instructions (procedural programming), OOP models real-world entities and their interactions, making code modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Principles of OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP is built on four main principles (often remembered as P.I.E.A. or A.P.I.E.):\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit (class).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Protects data from unauthorized access and unintended changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "- Allows a class (child) to reuse attributes and methods from another class (parent).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Promotes code reusability and reduces redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "- The same method name can have different behaviors depending on the object calling it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Makes code more flexible and adaptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduces complexity for the user of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### OOP in Python\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Class: A blueprint for creating objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Object: An instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Attributes: Variables inside a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Methods: Functions defined inside a class that operate on its attributes."

    "### 1. Software Development\n",
    "\n",
    "Use: Building modular and maintainable applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Banking System\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes: Account, Customer, Transaction\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects: A customer’s account, individual transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefit: If the bank wants to add online banking features, they can extend the existing Account class without rewriting the whole system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Game Development\n",
    "\n",
    "Use: Modeling characters, environments, and interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Video Game (e.g., GTA, PUBG)\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes: Player, Enemy, Weapon, Vehicle\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects: Specific player with name and health, specific car model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefit: You can create many different players or enemies by just creating new objects from the same blueprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. GUI (Graphical User Interface) Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Use: Managing windows, buttons, menus as objects.\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Desktop Calculator App\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes: Button, Display, CalculatorEngine\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects: The \"7\" button, the \"=\" button.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefit: Changing the design of one button class automatically updates all buttons in the app.\n",

    "### 4. Web Development\n",
    "\n",
    "Use: Organizing backend logic into reusable components.\n",

    "### 5. Data Science & Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Use: Structuring models and datasets.\n",
    "\n",
